Day 1 Project Overview: Smart Energy Consumption Tracker

The Day 1 project is an interactive "Smart Energy Consumption Tracker" web application built using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly. 
The primary goal of this application is to help users monitor, analyze, and optimize their daily and weekly household energy consumption,
with a focus on user-friendliness and actionable insights.

Key Components:
- Streamlit provides the user interface, allowing users to input their house type (Apartment, Villa, Row House, etc.), 
number of rooms (BHK), and configure appliance ratings and usage patterns.
- Users can choose between two tracking modes: "Daily Average" (simple daily hours for each appliance) or 
"Weekly Pattern" (customize usage for each day of the week).
- The app calculates total energy consumption for appliances like Air Conditioners, Fans, Lights, 
and Washing Machines, based on user inputs and room counts.
- Instant feedback is provided with metrics for total energy used (in kWh), 
cost estimates (using a default rate of â‚¹6 per kWh), and appliance-wise breakdowns.
- Advanced features include:
    - Visualization through dynamic charts (pie, bar, and weekly stacked bar charts) for better understanding of consumption patterns.
    - Data tables displaying daily and weekly summaries, as well as consumption history.
    - Insights and recommendations to optimize usage (e.g., consolidating washing machine usage, reducing high AC hours, 
      and comparing weekend vs. weekday patterns).
    - An "Efficiency Score" system that gives feedback on energy habits and suggests improvements.
    - The ability to save daily consumption records and review historical trends.
    - Energy-saving tips and personalized recommendations.

Technical Details:
- The main code is in `Day_1/Energy_Consumption_Calculator.py`.
- Required libraries are specified in `requirements.txt`:
    streamlit>=1.30.0
    pandas>=2.0.0
    plotly>=5.20.0

Purpose and Learning Outcome:
This project demonstrates hands-on skills in building a full-stack data-driven dashboard, with real-world applications 
in sustainability and home automation. Users not only learn Python and data visualization, but also gain practical 
understanding of monitoring and optimizing household energy use.

By tracking, visualizing, and reflecting on their energy habits, users can 
contribute to both personal cost savings and a greener future.
